# This is git helper.

- What you should do if you start working with git:
1. Initialize a git repository (git init);
2. Make necessary changes within this repository;
3. Add files to be committed to your repo (git add);
4. Commit files to a remote server (git commit -m 'message');
5. Synchronize local and remote repos via ssh with github, gitlab, etc.;
6. Look through the history of commits if necessary (when, what and who);
7. Go to step 2 to update your repo. 

### How to learn the commit history:
You may want to know what commits, when and by who were made.
You can easily do this with the built-in git history.
To access the history of commits, go to the main branch (directory where git was initialized) and type:
```
git log
```
