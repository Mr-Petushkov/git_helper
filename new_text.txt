I want to tell you something.

I have a lot of regrets and in current situation I cannot control my life.
At any moment they can me tell what, when and how I should do. That's what they call patriotism.

Whatever I did, when my phone suddenly rings, I have to stop doing it and listen to the commands from the phone.
I cannot live my life in the full meaning of life. How can I live if there are people who own me?
Only ownership means using people as you wish whenever you wish. How can your car have its own separate life?
You buy a car because you want to use it whenever you want!

That's what happens in my situation. I was born a slave.
There are people who control my every step in life.

Do you say black lives matter? You are all dickheads. Russians' lives don't matter in Russia.

My life costs nothing. If I want to say anything against this, I am labeled as a terrorist.
I have to fight against a hundred-years system, whose aim is to kill me, eat me like fresh meat.

I'm tired of being a slave. I'm tired of being useless and miserable.
People are stupid. The UN does nothing helpful. You all talk too much.
More than you should've talked in your whole life.

You're overconfident about how good life is. Life is terrible.
Life is frightening. It is scary, it makes souls dissolve through time.

I am stupid and there is nobody but me to help myself.
Family - big word, huh?

Family is a place where most people die. Because of a lack of money, attention and good relations.
Being sincere today is something super unusual. It's like walking outside naked.

And here I am. Here is my source code - absolutely plain, naked, nude and simple.
I hope that's what makes geniuses - simplicity and devotion.

Of course years after this commit they will laugh at me as they always did when I was sincere and spoke my mind.
Excuse me for being truthful. Excuse me for believing in humanity.

I hope you can control your daytime. Because I can't.
